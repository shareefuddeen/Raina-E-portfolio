        <p>
 
Teaching philosophy is your beliefs on how learning takes place and expresses the principles you use to guide your teaching in order to bring that learning to fruition.
Brookfield (1990) defines philosophy of teaching as “a personal vision of teaching, critical rational of teaching and a sense of purpose of teaching”. That is, a teaching philosophy reflects a teacher’s personal teaching values and beliefs. 
Many teachers think teaching is the impartation of knowledge to the learners. These kinds of teachers believe that learners are empty vessels and for that matter has nothing to contribute in the teaching and learning process. But that is not the case because knowledge is conveyed in our everyday movement and learners learn something new as they interact with the environment so learners may have something to contribute in the classroom environment.
<h1 className="text-xl font-sans">MY TEACHING PHILOSOPHY</h1>
My philosophy of teaching is to apply the concept of activity-based method of teaching and learning. That is, students participate thoroughly in the teaching and learning process and bring about efficient learning experiences.
Every student has an already formulated idea about how teaching and learning should be. And therefore, I believe my responsibility as a teacher is to inspire my students to learn and understand the theories and practical concepts of whatever they learn so as to use these concepts and the skills they gain from practice in solving problems and thereby enabling them pursue knowledge actively and become independent thinkers and not people who will just memorize ideas, as Farrant puts it “Knowledge gained by self-effort and discovery is better assimilated and remembered than that which is merely memorized”. By memorizing the subject matter, the students do not learn the concept but only store it for a short while and therefore cannot apply it practically. 
<h1 className="text-xl font-sans">STATEMENT OF MY TEACHING PHILOSOPHY</h1>

A teacher is not an encapsulation of all information and everybody can think and come up with ideas. Just that every single individual has his or her own specific manner of learning. 
It is a child-centred approach. It is a method in which the child is actively involved in participating mentally and physically. students are engaged in all the learning processes
A proper learning environment is created for the students to acquire knowledge rather than relying on only the teacher for knowledge.
At the point when students are effectively engaged with the learning procedure, it:
<ul className="my-4">
  <li>1.Promotes better understanding.</li>
  <li>2.It enhances self-efficacy in students.</li>
  <li>3.It gives opportunity to work independently and groups.</li>
  <li>4.It inspires the students to apply creative ideas, knowledge and minds in solving problems.</li>
  <li>5.It makes the learners feel at home during the lesson in the classroom.</li>
</ul>
<h1 className="text-xl font-sans">VALIDITY OF MY TEACHING PHILOSOPHY</h1>  

I trust that my philosophy is legitimate as in the students’ mind isn't a empty box which is yet to be loaded up with knowledge by the teacher but rather he or she goes to the classroom with assumptions.
The teacher’s duty is to guide; the pupil is treated as a plant, the teacher as gardener and the school as a garden. 
Information and Communication Technology is applied in our daily lives. They are found in almost every part of the world. They are used in our homes, schools, hospitals, banks and other offices. How known and applied in our lives is the most essential. Practical lessons make learners to practice, observe and get more knowledge about what he or she is learning.
<h1 className="text-xl font-sans">APPLICATION OF MY TEACHING PHILOSOPHY</h1>
In applying this philosophy, I always ensure that my teaching strategy takes into account each learner by involving them in activities such as discussion, demonstration, discovery and practice depending on the topic being treated at a particular moment. I also make use of teaching and learning materials to ensure practicality of my lesson. 
Also, I used questioning to achieve well-defined goals. As an instructor or a teacher, I asked questions that will require students to use their cognitive skills that he or she is trying to develop. I understand the fact that, a teacher should teach from the known to the unknown (lower to higher). I asked questions relating to the topic under study right after the lesson’s objectives have been said to them. I don’t only ask questions to begin the lesson but I also do that during and after the lesson is being delivered.
Lastly, I motivate students by awarding marks and the whole class clapping for the students. This makes the students try to take active part in the classroom activity and try to outdo their best in the class. 
<h1 className="text-xl font-sans">A PRACTICAL EXAMPLE OF MY PHILOSOPHY IN THE CLASSROOM SITTING.</h1>
I applied my philosophy in the classroom whenever I was teaching. One of the lessons I taught which I applied my philosophy was “Internet an Social Media”, I asked the learners to mention some means by which they communicate with relatives and friends . I guided them as some people were called to answer the question. I created a conducive environment  where every learner feels free to share their views without fear, both male and female were called to answer questions in the classroom. All the learners took part in the teaching and learning process and I served as a facilitator. 
<h1 className="text-xl font-sans">EFFECTIVENESS OF MY TEACHING PHILOSOPHY</h1>

My philosophy of teaching is effective because the learners felt comfortable and realised that their options are accepted, this makes them contribute, use their thinking skills to make the class a better platform for learning. An educational philosophy is not static, it changes with time and experience and I will continually reflect, examine and refine what I believe and why I believe.
<h1 className="text-xl font-sans">CONCLUSION</h1>
John Comenius once said “I seek the method that will make learners learn more and teachers teach less”. This is implying that the more learners learn that is practice the more skill they acquire and the teacher teaching less is pointing the students to the right direction on how to apply certain theories.
