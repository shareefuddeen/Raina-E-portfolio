<h1 className="text-xl font-sans">REFLECTIVE PRACTICE
</h1>

In my opinion, teaching is a continuous self-appraisal. Feedback is one of the vital tools, which provide an answer to every human activity meant to achieve an objective. One of the most productive means of getting appropriate feedback is reflection.
Reflective practice in teaching is a way of looking at your everyday teaching experiences with an open mind. Reflection can help one to identify ways to improve the quality of his/her work. This write-up is a summary of my reflection on the lesson, basic input and output devices at Action Educational Complex.
After delivering lessons to the students, there is the need sit back and reflect on the activities that took place in the classroom. He/she (teacher) must produce a mental picture of the activities that took place in the classroom to identify his strengths and weaknesses and how best to improve on subsequent lessons.

<h1 className="text-xl font-sans">INTRODUCTION</h1>
I introduce the lesson by asking students to describe how they communicate with friends and relatives who far from where they live.
After this, I tell pupils the objectives of the lesson and ask the following question:

TLM’s
Laptop, Mobile phone, Internet access, whiteboard, marker, projector demonstrated to the pupils when the time was due.


<h1 className="text-xl font-sans">DEVELOPMENT</h1>

I used discussion to guide pupils to grasp the .
I wrote the definition of input devices on the marker board for pupils to copy into their notebooks.
I explain certain words in the definition for them to understand it better.

<h1 className="text-xl font-sans">APPLICATION</h1>
I assist the learners to identify and describe the social networking sites by projecting them on the board to them. And also, through brainstorming   helped the pupils state the functions of the social networking sites that have been identified. I also used question and answer method to evaluate my lesso.n
Learners were asked questions orally and a room was provided for discussions.

<h1 className="text-xl font-sans">EVALUATION AND CLOSURE
</h1>

I summarized the major ideas raised in the lesson and asked them oral evaluation questions after which I gave them a reading assignment and made way for the next lesson.
The lesson was taught successfully due to the following measures which were taken;
Communication was done at the level of learners.
The lesson was linked to the pupil’s prerequisite knowledge on the topic
TLMS were used to enhance pupils understanding 
The lesson was presented in a systematic order 
 Class room management was very effective  

<h1 className="text-xl font-sans">CHALLENGES</h1>

Though the lesson was successful, upon careful reflection on the lesson taught, there were some challenges due to the following reasons;
Since the lesson was taught at the last period, students were mostly tired and their concentration level was very low. This made student participation in the lesson very difficult.
I noticed also, that the lesson would have been easily understood if all the learners had mobile phones or computers  to navigate through each of the sites . 

<h1 className="text-xl font-sans">INNOVATION</h1>

After a critical reflection I did not know what to do because the lesson was over, but fortunately, I discussed it with my mentor and he gave me another chance to re-teach the same lesson on a different day. I then adjusted in the components that were absent in my first lesson by;
On the second lesson, I ensured that students are energized enough before I begun the lesson. I also included the learners in the lesson, so student’s participation was very high making the class more interesting. 

<h1 className="text-xl font-sans">INSIGHT GAINED</h1>
I realized that when lessons are made practical to learners, they understand what they are taught better 

<h1 className="text-xl font-sans">CONCLUSION</h1>
In conclusion, reflection is an important aspect of the teaching and learning process, and I urge colleague teachers to make reflection on their lessons an integral part of their professional lives as teachers, since in the long run it gives remedy to help shape teaching and learning to bring out the desired behavior in pupils.
Thank you.
